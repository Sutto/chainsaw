Ohm is a library that allows to store an object in
[Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/), a persistent key-value
database. It includes an extensible list of validations and has very
good performance.

    require 'ohm'

    Ohm.connect

    class Event < Ohm::Model
      attribute :name

      list :comments

      index :name

      def validate
        assert_present :name
      end
    end

    event = Event.create(:name => "Ruby Tuesday")
    event.participants << "Michel Martens"
    event.participants << "Damian Janowski"
    event.participants.all #=> ["Damian Janowski", "Michel Martens"]

    event.comments << "Very interesting event!"
    event.comments << "Agree"
    event.comments.all #=> ["Very interesting event!", "Agree"]

    another_event = Event.new
    another_event.valid?    #=> false
    another_event.errors    #=> [[:name, :nil]]

    another_event.name = ""
    another_event.valid?    #=> false
    another_event.errors    #=> [[:name, :empty]]

    another_event.name = "Ruby Lunch"
    another_event.create    #=> true
